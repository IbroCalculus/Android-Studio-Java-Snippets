===== WHAT IS ROOM & WHY TO USE IT =========
Room provides an abstraction layer over SQLite to allow fluent database access while harnessing the full power of SQLite.



===== 3 STEPS TO IMPLEMENT ROOM DATABASE =======
You will need the following:
1- Database class
2- An Entity (an object representing a table with its corresponding columns)
3- DAO Interface ((DAO: Data Access Object) contains methods for accessing the database). Similar to DatabaseHelper class and defining the CRUD operations.


======== 5 major components of Database class =========
It should:
1. Be annotated with @Database
2. Be an abstract class
3. Extend RoomDatabase
4. include the list of entities (called tables in sqlite) associated with that database.
5. Contain an abstract method that has "0" arguments and returns an interface (which is annotated with @Dao) through which you access the methods required to communicate with your database.
