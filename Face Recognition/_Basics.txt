====== HOW FACE RECOGNITION WORKS =========
- Firstly, Face Registration,
- Secondly, Face recognition

---- Face Registration -----
1. Pass the image to a Face detection model
2. The detected face is cropped out of the image and passed through a face recognition model
3. This recegnised face is passed through face embedding
4. Save this face embedding to a username in a database
-FACE EMBEDDING: is the numerical representation of the face image generated by the face recognition model. It is an array of floats

---- Face Recognition -----
In face recognition, we generate and compare face embedding for faces to determine if they belong to the same person.

- In android, there are basically 2 face recognition models: FaceNet model and Mobile FaceNet Model
- We use the Face detection ML Library for android: https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/vision/face-detection/android
