Android application consists of 4 main building blocks, which are:
1. Activity
2. Services
3. Broadcast receivers
4. Content providers

- Activity is the main android component and it is used for interaction with the user.
  Basically that is the starting point of our app where a user can see our UI and can interact with it.

- Services run in background.
