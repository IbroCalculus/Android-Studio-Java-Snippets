Splash screens are typically implemented using one of three approaches:

1. Using Timers (the old school habits)
2. Using a Launcher Theme (The Recommended way). Check Splash Screen2.txt
3. Splash Screen API (Android 12)

A splash screenâ€™s function is to immediately show an attractive screen while the application retrieves any relevant content (from a database or network calls).

To hide the status bar on the splash screen or any other activity, check Status Bar.txt

Always use Intent finish() in the splash screen

1. USE EasySplashScreen library

2. 

    private static final int SPLASH_DURATION = 4000;

setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);

        Handler handler = new Handler();
        handler.postDelayed(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                startActivity(new Intent(getApplicationContext(), MainActivity.class));
                finish();
            }
        }, SPLASH_DURATION);	//SPLASH_DURATION is in milliseconds. ie 4 seconds in this case.
