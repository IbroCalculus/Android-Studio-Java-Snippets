Visit firebase, Android section (See options like Authentication, realtimeDB, cloudFirestore, storage etc)

Tools -> Firebase -> Analytics -> Log an Analytics Event -> Connect to Firebase -> Auto Launch Browser -> Create project -> Uncheck Google Analytics ... -> Connect firebase

========== Fix "Connect to Firebase" error, if occurred =====================
Go to "Project Structure" (Close to Run, Debug, AVD Manager, etc),
Goto Modules tab
Set "Compile sdk Version" to 30 or higher. (31 tested)
Set "Build tools version" to 30.0.2 or higher. (31.0.0 tested)
Apply and OK

This maybe helpful as well;  Go to "Build" -> Make project
