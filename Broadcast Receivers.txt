 Broadcast receiver is a messaging system used on android devices between the android OS and android applications.
 The android OS shares device related information with android applications.

 The broadcast messages are sent when an event of interest occurs.
 For example, System Boots, Device Starts Chargin, when the charge of the device is low, etc.
 
 When a broadcast is sent, the system automatically routes broadcasts to apps that have subscribed to receive that particular type of broadcast.
