 CHECK ALSO; Database (for basic intro)

  ------ ALTERNATIVE TO SQLITE IN ANDROID IS ROOM DATABASE ----
- Room database is a new concept for creating a database in android applications introduced in 2017
- Room database creates an Abstract Layer above the SQLite Database.
- It is preferred over sqlite to ensure data persistency.


 The room database has 3 main components, ie
 1- Entity: It represents the table and its correspoding columns.
 2- DAO (Data Access Object): It is a method that is used to access the database. (Similar to DatabaseHelper class)
 3- Database: It is a class that holds entities and database version. This class content also describe the list of DAOs

====== Architectural Room Database ========
 Room database does not work alone, it works with auxiliary components known as "Architectural Components".
 Room applications and architectural components will come together to develop android applications.

-The purpose of Architectural Components is to guide Application Architecture.

 There are 3 components that ake up the Architectural components, and they are;
1. ViewModel
2. LiveData
3. Repository
 
- A ViewModel is a class that is used to store and manage data to be displayed in the User Interface.
- The viewModel concept ensures that data is not lost and is maintained in configuration change situations such as screen rotation or language change.
- ViewModel acts as a bridge between data and the user interface such as an activity or fragment.

==== LiveData ====
- This constantly monitors changes in the livedata database and reflects it instantly in components such as activities.


==== Repository ====
- This manages data exchanges between component databases, ie between local databases or online (known as REST APIs).
