========== CREATE CUSTOM FILE =============
	layout -> New -> Layout Fesource File

	- Create contents as required within the layout
	- Leave Parent Layout height and width as match parent.


======== IN OTHER ACTIVITIES WHERE CUSTOM LAYOUT WILL BE USED =============
	--- Assume layout id is "header"

    <include
        layout="@layout/header"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content"
        android:layout_marginTop="32dp"
        app:layout_constraintEnd_toEndOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintStart_toStartOf="parent"
        app:layout_constraintTop_toTopOf="parent" />


NB: All codes for the custom layout will be within each of its including activity.
    Not like fragment which has its xml and layout file.
